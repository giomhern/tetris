# Tetris: A C++ Approach

This was a small little project to put my C++ skills to the test. It was built with rather simple, but efficient data structures. 
So, if you ever wanted to run a pure C++ implementation of Tetris, here you go. I plan on adding more features that might be niche, 
but do not know yet.
